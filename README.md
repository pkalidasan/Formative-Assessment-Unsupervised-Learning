# Formative-Assessment-Unsupervised-Learning
The objective of this project is to evaluate the understanding and application of clustering techniques using the Iris dataset.In the dataset we will , preprocess it, and apply two clustering algorithms- (KMeans and Hierarchical clustering). The results will be visualized to understand the clusters formed by each method.
